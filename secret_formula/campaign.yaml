  The secret formula for a chemical compound with potential military applications has been stolen.
  The theft occurred at the Jorvik Advanced Research Laboratory (JARL), a cutting-edge facilitylocated in the bustling technology district of Jorvik, a densely populated and modern fictional city.
  The formula was stolen from a secure vault in the basement level, indicating the operation was highly organized and executed with precision.
  The incident happened three days ago, during a narrow window between 2:00 AM and 4:00 AM. Both physical and cyber security systems were disabled during this time.
  Sara Chen, the lead research scientist, is the one who discovered the theft and called the police.
  Evidence points to an inside job, as the perpetrators seemed to have intimate knowledge of the facility's security protocols.
  The stolen formula is dangerous and could be weaponized to cause widespread harm if not recovered promptly.
  The interrogation will take place at JARL, the day after the theft.
  Your mission is to uncover the identity of the thieves and retrieve the formula before it's too late.
