campaign.title: The Secret Formula
campaign.intro_message: Under the neon glow of Jorvik’s sprawling technology district, the whispers of treachery have begun to spread. At the heart of this hive of innovation lies the Jorvik Advanced Research Laboratory (JARL), a fortress of scientific advancement now overshadowed by a grave betrayal. Three nights past, within the stealthy strokes of dawn between 2 and 4 AM, the unthinkable happened. A highly coveted chemical formula, buried within the depths of the basement vault, vanished. The hack was seamless—security systems blinked out like stars before the twilight. Whispers say Sara Chen, the watchful lead scientist, uncovered the void left behind. Evidence swirls in shadow, suggesting treason from within. Time is a predator now; the formula must be retrieved before it morphs into destruction untold.
